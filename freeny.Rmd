A codebook shows the structure, contents and layout of data. We should always study the codebook to understand the variables before conducting any research on the data.

The creation of codebook is demonstrated using Freenyâ€™s Revenue Data in 2 ways - automated codebook and custom-made codebook.

## 1. About The Data

The Freeny's Revenue Data (freeny) is used in this demonstraton. The data consists of 39 observations showing quarterly revenue from 1962 2nd quarter to 1971 4th quarter. 

The data originates from A. E. Freeny (1977) in *A Portable Linear Regression Package with Test Programs* by Bell Laboratories memorandum.

However, it remains unknown how the author created or collected the data, and whether it is based on quarterly performance on a real or fictitious company, as well as the exact units used for the measurements (thousands, millions etc.)

The data is included in the R Datasets package developed by R Core Team and contributors. The package also contains dozens of other datasets and is available in base R.

For more on the data, check out https://rdrr.io/r/datasets/freeny.html

## 2. Exploring Dataset

### Loading Data

Load the *memisc* package required to create automated codebook. The package name stands for "Management of Survey Data and Presentation of Analysis Results". The documentation can be found at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/memisc/memisc.pdf

```{r}
library(memisc)
```

Load the dataset.

```{r}
data("freeny")
```

### Showing Data

Show the first few lines of the dataset.

```{r}
head(freeny)
```

View the dataset in the R Studio data viewer.

```{r}
View(freeny)
```

### Data Attributes

Show the dimension of the dataset. 39 observations and 5 variables are found.

```{r}
dim(freeny)
```

Show the column names. It appears that y is the revenue, and the other 4 variables are the explanatory variables.

```{r}
names(freeny)
```

Show the row names of the dataset. It appears that each row represent a quarter of the period.

```{r}
row.names(freeny)
```

Show the attributes of the dataset.

```{r}
attributes(freeny)
```

### Variables in Data

Based on the findings above and general knowledge in economics, a summary of the variables can be drawn up below.

| Variable | Description | Units |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| row.names | Quarter | Year & Quarter |
| y | Quarterly revenue | $, possibly in million |
| lag.quarterly.revenue | Quarterly revenue in last quarter | $, possibly in million |
| price.index | Price index (possibly consumer price index) | Possibly % |
| income.level | Income level | Unknown |
| market.potential | Market potential | $, possibly in million |

### Data Types

Check the type of the dataset. It's found to be a list.

```{r}
typeof(freeny)
```

Check the class of the dataset. It's found to be a data frame.

```{r}
class(freeny)
```

## 3. Automated Codebook

### Codebook Function

The *codebook* function of the *memisc* package is used to automatically generate a codebook of a dataset. It shows the statistics of the dataset including minimum value, maximum value, mean, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis of the data.

```{r}
codebook(freeny)
```

### Summary Function

Show the summary statistics of all variables in the dataset.

```{r}
summary(freeny)
```

## 4. Custom-Made Codebook

Instead of automatic generation of codebook, here the same information is shown by using individual R functions manually.

### Data Types

Show the type of each variable.

```{r}
sapply(freeny, typeof)
```

Show the class of each variable.

```{r}
sapply(freeny, class)
```

### Descriptive Statistics

Show the mean of each column.

```{r}
sapply(freeny, mean)
```

Show the minimum value of each variable.

```{r}
sapply(freeny, min)
```

Show the maximum value of each variable.

```{r}
sapply(freeny, max)
```

Show the range of each variable.

```{r}
sapply(freeny, range)
```

Show the first quartile of each variable.

```{r}
sapply(freeny, quantile, 0.25)
```

Show the median of each variable.

```{r}
sapply(freeny, median)
```

Show the third quartile of each variable.

```{r}
sapply(freeny, quantile, 0.75)
```

Show the interquartile range of each variable.

```{r}
sapply(freeny, IQR)
```

Show the variance of each variable.

```{r}
sapply(freeny, var)
```

Show the standard deviation of each variable.

```{r}
sapply(freeny, sd)
```

The *moments* package is included to show skewness and kurtosis.

```{r}
# install.packages('moments') # Install the package if necessary
library(moments)
```

Show the skewness of each variable.

```{r}
sapply(freeny, skewness)
```


Show the kurtosis of each variable.

```{r}
sapply(freeny, kurtosis)
```

### Visualizing Data

Histograms are generated for all variables for data visualization.

```{r}
sapply(1:length(freeny), function (x) {
  var_name <- names(freeny[x])
  hist(freeny[[x]], main = paste0('Histogram - ', var_name), xlab = var_name, ylab = 'Frequency')
})
```

Line plots are generated for all variables for data visualization.

```{r}
sapply(1:length(freeny), function (x) {
  var_name <- names(freeny[x])
  plot(row.names(freeny[x]), freeny[[x]], type = 'l', main = paste0('Line Plot - ', var_name), xlab = 'Quarter', ylab = var_name)
})
```
